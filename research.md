My research seeks to understand the factors governing the distribution, abundance, and biodiversity of marine species ranging from phytoplankton to apex predators and at scales ranging from small scale experimental to global. I am interested in exploring how environmental changes and human impacts interact to shape the structure of communities and ecosystems across the seascape and over time. I primarily investigate these questions by applying statistical models and methods to data that are available over large spatial and temporal scales in the ocean. This general approach is referred to as *macroecology*, and provides a means of understanding and testing the generality of ecological dynamics that often are difficult to resolve using smaller-scale experimental or field-based approaches. Whenever possible, my research also incorporates information from field-based and experimental approaches.
Brief summaries of my current research interests and selected published examples of these topics are listed:

1. Predator-prey dynamics and community stability .

<img src="/images/trophiccontrol_researchnw.jpg" align='right' width="200" height="200" /> Understanding feeding interactions between predators and their prey (trophic interactions) yields valuable insights into how and why marine populations undergo collapse and recovery, forecasting how species and ecosystems will change into the future, and for developing strategies for how to manage populations of exploited marine species. Resolving these questions is extremely challenging. Changes in populations and ecosystems are also strongly influenced by additional factors such as environmental variation and human activities. My work studies how these external factors interact with internal predator-prey dynamics to shape the distribution and structure of life in the oceans.

2. Patterns, drivers, and consequences of marine phytoplankton change.

<img src="/images/phytoplankton_researchnw.jpg" align='right' width="275" height="325" /> Marine phytoplankton generate the energy which supports virtually all marine ecosystems and thus determine the abundance and diversity of marine organisms, the structure of ecosystems, and set the upper limits on fishery harvests. Through their effects on global biogeochemical cycles, marine phytoplankton also have strong impacts on climate processes. Despite this critical and far-reaching importance, our understanding of how and why marine phytoplankton levels have changed over the long-term is limited. I've been researching this topic at local, regional, and global scales using a combination of thoeretical, macroecological, experimental, and field-based approaches.

3. How and why biodiversity is changing and the consequences of these changes.

 Biodiversity, the number and abundance of species, is critically important to the health of marine ecosystems. Ecosystems with higher biodiversity tend to be more productive, provide more services to humans, and are better able to withstand and recover from stress. <img src="/images/biodiveristy_researchnw.jpg" align='left' width="325" height="200" /> My research seeks to understand how and why biodiversity varies, how to maintain and promote biodiversity, and what effects changing biodiversity levels have on predator-prey interactions within marine ecosystems.
