#####My research interests are focused on understanding the factors governing the distribution, abundance, and biodiversity of marine species ranging from phytoplankton to apex predators and at scales ranging from small scale experimental to global. I am interesting in exploring how environmental changes and human impacts interact to shape the structure of communities and ecosystems across the seascape and over time. I primarily investigate these questions by applying statistical models and methodologies to data that are available over large spatial and temporal scales in the ocean. This general approach is  referred to as *macroecology*, and provides a means of understanding and testing the generality of ecological dynamics that often cannot be resolved using smaller-scale experimental or field-based approaches. Whenever possible, my research also involves field-based, and experimentatal approaches.

#####Brief summaries of my current research interestes and selected published examples of these topics are listed:

#####1. How predator-prey dynamics and community stability vary within and across marine ecosystems and in response to varying environmenal and human influences.

<img src="/images/trophiccontrol_researchnw.jpg" align='right' width="200" height="200" /> Feeding interactions between predators and their prey (trophic interactions) have profound impacts on the distribution and abundance of populations of marine species and on the  emergent structure and functioning of large marine ecosystems. Thus, understanding how and why these species interactions occur yields valuable insights into how and why marine populations undergo collapse and recovery, forecasting how species and ecosystems will change into the future, and for developing strategies for how to manage populations of exploited marine species. Resolving these questions is extremely challenging. In addition to predator-prey dynamics, changes in populations and ecosystems are also strongly influenced by external factors such as environmental variation and human activities. My work studies how these external factors interract with internal predator-prey dynamics to shape the distribution and structure of life in the oceans.

#####2. Understanding the patterns, drivers, and consequences of marine phytoplankton changes over the past century.

<img src="/images/phytoplankton_researchnw.jpg" align='right' width="275" height="325" /> Marine phytoplankton generate the energy which supports virtually all marine ecosystems and thus determine the abundance and diversity of marine organisms, the structure and functioning of ecosystems, and set the upper limits on fishery harvests. Through their effects on global biogeochemical cycles, particularly the carbon cycle, marine phytoplankton also have strong impacts on climate processes. Despite this critical and far-reaching importance, our understanding of how and why marine phytoplankton levels have changed over the long-term is limited. I've been researching this topic at local, regional, and global scales using a combination of thoeretical, macroecological, experimental, and field-based approaches.

#####3. Explaining how and why biodiversity is changing over time and across space and the consequences of these changes.

 Biodiversity, the number and abundance of species, is critically important to the functions and services provided by marine ecosystems. Ecosystems with higher biodiversity tend to be more productive, resistant and resilient to  perturbation. Alternately, ecosystems with lower biodiversity tend to provide fewer ecosystem services (fisheries yield, <img src="/images/biodiveristy_researchnw.jpg" align='left' width="325" height="200" /> nursery habitat, filter functioning), and are associated with increased risks (species extinction, beach closures, harmful algal blooms, hypoxia, fish kills, coastal flooding). I strive to understand how and why biodiversity varies, how to maintain and promote biodiversity, and what effects changing biodiversity levels has on predator-prey interactions within marine ecosystems.
