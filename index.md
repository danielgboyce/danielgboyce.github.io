I am a quantitative marine ecologist working at [Dalhousie University][dalu]. My research interests revolve around themes of understanding how stressors, such as climate change and fishing, are shifting the abundance and distribution of marine species across the global seascape, how these changes will affect the health and development of coastal communities, and how to incorporate this knowledge into marine spatial planning and fisheries management. To address these interdisciplinary questions, I use statistical analyses, field-based approaches, and experimentation and work with researchers in academia, managers and scientists within the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans, and with non-governmental organizations. 

Presently, 50% of my time is spent working with the Ocean Frontier Institute ([Ocean Frontier Institute][ofi]) evaluating (1) How the abundance and distribution marine life, from phytoplankton, to top predators, will change over the coming century and how these changes will impact the sustainable development of coastal communities, and (2) The capacity of spatial protection to imbue marine ecosystems with increased resistance and stability to the deleterious effects of climate change. The remainder of my time is spent as a contract researcher with Oceans North, a national non-governmental organization, reviewing progress and recommending best practices for how to incorporate climate change considerations into the management of ocean resources in the Canadian Maritimes and Arctic regions.
