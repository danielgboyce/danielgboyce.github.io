I am a quantitative marine ecologist working within the [Ocean Frontier Institute][ofi] based at [Dalhousie University][dalu]. My research interests are broad, but share a common theme of understanding how marine species interact with each other and their environments and how human activities affect and are affected by changes within large marine ecosystems. More specific examples of my research activities include resolving how and why marine phytoplankton levels have changed over the past century, predicting patterns of marine biodiversity, population dynamics of Atlantic Herring, biophysical drivers of predator-prey interractions, global patterns of marine phytoplantkon phenology, and the effects of fishing on the dynamics of marine species. To address these questions I use statistical analyses, field-based approaches, and experimentation.

I'm currently focussed on predicting how the abundance and distribution marine life will change over the coming century and incorporating this knowledge into spatial protection strategies.

In my current position, I am engaged in advancing the scientific understanding of how ocean ecosystems will respond to climate change over the coming century and how to incorporate this knowledge to increase the effectiveness of spatial protection strategies.
