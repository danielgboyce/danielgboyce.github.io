I am a marine ecologist working for Queens University in Kingston, Ontario and the Bedford Institute of Oceanography in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. 

My research interests are focussed on understanding the factors governing trophic control in marine ecosystems, how and why marine phytoplankton has changed over the long-term, and patterns of marine biodiversity. The tools I use to adress these important questions includes the analyses of observational datasets, field observations, and experimentation.
