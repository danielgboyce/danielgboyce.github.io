##EDUCATION
----------

#####2007-2013
#####Ph.D. in Biology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada
* Thesis title: ‘Global patterns of marine phytoplankton change over the past century’. Supervisor: Dr. Boris Worm, and working in collaboration with Dr. Marlon Lewis.
* This research focused on long term (1890 to present) and large scale (global) changes in marine phytoplankton biomass and the factors driving these changes and consequences therein.
* Thesis work required statistical analyses of large, complex oceanographic datasets as well as mesocosm experiments. 
* 2nd chapter of thesis was published as an article in Nature; selected as Discover Magazines top 100 science stories of 2010 (#30), and has been highly cited since publication
* Awarded CAGS/UMI distinguished dissertation award for the best doctoral dissertation in Canada in the engineering, medical, and natural sciences for 2014 ($3000 award value).
* Awarded Dalhousie University best doctoral thesis in the natural sciences and engineering in 2013-2014.

#####1998-2006
####B.Sc. (Honors) Biology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada, 
* Thesis title: ‘Effects of water temperature on global patterns of tuna and billfish’. 
* Supervisor: Dr. Boris Worm. 
* Research focussed on habitat modeling the spatial distribution of tunas and billfishes as a function of sea surface temperature fields.
* Research required the synthesis of published scientific literature, the derivation of habitat models, and the analysis of global long-term fishery databases. 
* Undergraduate thesis awarded highest marks in graduating class (99%) and published in a leading peer-reviewed journal.
